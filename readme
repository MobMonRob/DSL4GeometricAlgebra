--> add LSP-Server to a specific classpath of the GraalVM to be available to start

- only lsp.jar needed, api is to extend the LS

-Dtruffle.class.path.append=lsp-tool-24.1.1.jar

The Truffle framework offers a clear separation between the language/tooling code and the application code. 
For this reason, putting the JAR file on the class path will not result in the framework realizing a new tool 
is needed. To achieve this we use --vm.Dtruffle.class.path.append=/path/to/simpletool-<version>.jar as is 
illustrated in a launcher script for our simple tool. This script also shows we can set the CLI options we 
specified for Simple Tool. This means that if we execute ./simpletool js example.js, we will launch the js 
launcher of GraalVM, add the tool to the framework class path, and run the included example.js file with 
Simple Tool enabled.
